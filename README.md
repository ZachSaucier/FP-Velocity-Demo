FP Velocity Demo
================

## [Demo](http://zachsaucier.com/fp.html)

Created for the Velocity.js release in spring 2014 in order to show some of the capabilities of the library. The intent is to create a more intensive demo that shows how well Velocity handles animation performance.

For this to be able to run you need to grab a copy of Velocity from the [GitHub page](https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity).
